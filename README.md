# ParsingCards
An app for educational purpose that makes it easy to add new contacts, manage them and improve your relationship with people. 
By leveraging the power of Natural Language processing, just type the info you want to save: the app will take care of tagging 
them as name, phone number or email accordingly.

App Icon created by me using SF Symbols.

CoreML Model created by me. Few data but it works. 
If you want to share a more complete model with me, I will be happy to implement it and credit your work.
